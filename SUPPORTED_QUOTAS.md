# Supported Service Quotas

The Service Quotas Manager (SQM) works by collecting quota usage and comparing them against applicable quotas.
The table below shows an overview of all services in AWS Service Quotas and to what extend usage for their related
service quotas can be collected.

Please note that extending support is one of the goals of this project and an ongoing effort. Also, not all quotas
are eligable for support as their usage might only be available to AWS internally.
